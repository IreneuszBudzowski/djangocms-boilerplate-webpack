The django CMS Boilerplate Webpack is the most complete **django CMS** based
Boilerplate for rapid development. It uses the full potential of
`ES2015+ <https://babeljs.io/>`_, `Webpack <https://webpack.github.io/>`_ and
the `Bootstrap <http://getbootstrap.com/>`_ framework for developing responsive,
mobile-first projects on the web, and implements various best practices from
within the front-end community.

This Boilerplate can be used with standalone django CMS websites as well as
on the `Divio Cloud <http://www.divio.com/>`_ platform.

The latest stable version is available on GitHub -
https://github.com/divio/djangocms-boilerplate-webpack.
